Installation
------------

First, a couple of things to note:

* You need to be on Windows, Linux, or OS X.
* You need to have the QtCore libraries and headers installed.
* You need to have the libraries and headers for libavutil
  and libswscale installed.
* You need to have either GCC, Clang, MSVC, or ICC/ICL installed.
  Both a C and C++ compiler are required.
* You need to have Yasm installed.
* You need Python 3 to build the Cython wrapper.
* You need to have Cython installed in your Python 3 environment
  in order to invoke the setup script.

First off, you'll want to fetch Waf which is the build tool
VapourSynth uses:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

You don't have to fetch it with this script (it requires Wget);
you can also simply download it from the official Google Code
repository: http://code.google.com/p/waf

Then, configure the project:

    $ ./waf configure

The configure operation has some options which can be used to
fine-tune the build:

* --prefix=path (default: /usr/local)
  Specifies where to install the final VapourSynth artifacts.
* --mode=debug/release (default: release)
  Specifies what mode to compile C and C++ code in. When in
  debug mode, debug info and debugging helpers will be emitted
  by the compiler, and no optimization will be done. In release
  mode, all (safe) optimizations are performed and no debug
  info is generated.
* --static=true/false (default: false)
  Specifies whether to build a static library in addition to the
  shared library.
* --filters=true/false (default: true)
  Specifies whether to build the included filters. These are
  always built as shared libraries.
* --cython=true/false (default: true)
  Specifies whether to preprocess the Cython sources. This is
  required if you plan to build and install the Cython wrapper.
* --avisynth=true/false (default: true)
  Specifies whether to build the Avisynth compatibility layer
  when building on Windows.

Once the project is configured, simply execute:

    $ ./waf build

By default, Waf builds tasks in parallel. You can control the
level of parallelism with the -j option, like with Make.

If you want to build the Cython wrapper, you can do so now by
executing:

    $ ./setup.py build

Finally, to install VapourSynth:

    $ ./waf install

And to uninstall:

    $ ./waf uninstall

To install the Cython wrapper:

    $ ./setup.py install

Note that the setup script has a --prefix option like Waf.
