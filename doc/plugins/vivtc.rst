VIVTC
=====

VIVTC is a set of filters that can be used for inverse telecine. It is a rewrite of some of tritical's TIVTC filters.

.. function:: VFM(clip clip, int order[, int field=order, int mode=1, bint mchroma=1, int cthresh=9, int mi=80, bint chroma=1, int blockx=16, int blocky=16, int y0=16, int y1=16, float scthresh=12, int micmatch=1, bint micout=0, clip clip2])
   :module: vivtc

   VFM is a field matching filter that recovers the original progressive frames from a telecined stream. VFM's output will contain duplicated frames, which is why it must be further processed by a decimation filter, like VDecimate.

   Unlike TFM, VFM does not have any postprocessing capabilities.

   VFM adds the following properties to every frame it outputs:
      VFMMics
         Array of five integers.

         It will contain the mic values for the five possible matches (p/c/n/b/u). Some of them may be unset (-1), depending on *micout* and *micmatch*.

      _Combed
         1 if VFM thinks the frame is combed, 0 if not.

      VFMMatch
         Match used for the frame.

         0 = p

         1 = c

         2 = n

         3 = b

         4 = u

      VFMSceneChange
         1 if VFM thinks the frame is a scene change, 0 if not.


   Parameters:
      clip
         Input clip. Only YUV420P8 with constant dimensions supported.

      order
         Sets the field order of the clip. If this parameter has the wrong value, VFM's output will be visibly wrong.

         0 - bottom field first

         1 - top field first

      field
         Sets the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value
         as *order* unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In certain
         circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a large impact
         on matching performance.

         0 - bottom field

         1 - top field

         Default: same as *order*.

      mode
         Sets the matching mode or strategy to use. Plain 2-way matching (option 0) is the
         safest of all the options in the sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to
         duplicate frames when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will
         end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. 3-way matching +
         trying the 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are detected as combed
         (option 5) is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always
         find a good frame if there is one. The other settings (options 1, 2, 3, and 4) are all
         somewhere in between options 0 and 5 in terms of risking jerkiness and creating
         duplicate frames vs. finding good matches in sections with bad edits, orphaned fields,
         blended fields, etc.

         Possible settings are::

            0 = 2-way match                                                          (p/c)
            1 = 2-way match + 3rd match on combed                                    (p/c + n)
            2 = 2-way match + 3rd match (same order) on combed                       (p/c + u)
            3 = 2-way match + 3rd match on combed + 4th/5th matches if still combed  (p/c + n + u/b)
            4 = 3-way match                                                          (p/c/n)
            5 = 3-way match + 4th/5th matches on combed                              (p/c/n + u/b)

         The () at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming order=1
         and field=1.

         0 is the fastest and 5 is the slowest.

         Default: 1.

      mchroma
         Sets whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most
         cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. Only if your clip has bad chroma
         problems such as heavy rainbowing or other artifacts should you set this to false.
         Setting this to false could also be used to speed things up at the cost of some 
         accuracy.

         Default: true.

      cthresh
         This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially
         controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected. Larger values
         mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing can be less
         visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from -1 (every pixel
         will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will be detected as combed). This
         is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is between 8 to 12.
         
         Default: 9.

      mi
         The number of combed pixels inside any of the *blockx* by *blocky* size blocks on the frame
         for the frame to be detected as combed. While *cthresh* controls how "visible" the
         combing must be, this setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized
         area (a window defined by the *blockx* and *blocky* settings) on the frame. The minimum is 0,
         the maximum is *blocky* * *blockx* (at which point no frames will ever be detected as combed).
         
         Default: 80.

      chroma
         Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only
         disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc) that are
         causing problems for the combed frame detection with *chroma* enabled. Actually,
         using chroma=false is usually more reliable, except in case there
         is chroma-only combing in the source.

         Default: true.

      blockx

      blocky
         Sets the size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has
         to do with the size of the area in which *mi* number of pixels are required to be
         detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the *mi* parameter
         description for more info. Possible values are any power of 2 between 4 and 512.

         Defaults: 16, 16.

      y0

      y1
         The rows from *y0* to *y1* will be excluded from the field matching decision.
         This can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may interfere with the matching.
         Set *y0* equal to *y1* to disable.

         Defaults: 16, 16.

      scthresh
         Sets the scenechange threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane.
         Good values are in the 8 to 14 range. 

         Default: 12.

      micmatch
         When micmatch is greater than 0, tfm will take into account the mic values of matches
         when deciding what match to use as the final match. Only matches that could be used
         within the current matching mode are considered. micmatch has 3 possible settings:

         0 - disabled. Modes 1, 2 and 3 effectively become identical to mode 0. Mode 5 becomes identical to mode 4.

         1 - micmatching will be used only around scene changes. See the *scthresh* parameter.

         2 - micmatching will be used everywhere.

         Default: 1.

      micout
         If true, VFM will calculate the mic values for all possible matches (p/c/n/b/u).
         Otherwise, only the mic values for the matches allowed by *mode* will be calculated.

         Default: false.

      clip2
         Clip that VFM will use to create the output frames. If *clip2* is used, VFM will perform all calculations based on *clip*, but will copy the chosen fields from *clip2*. This can be used to work around VFM's video format limitations. For example::
         
            # Assume original is a YUV444P16 clip.
            yv12 = c.resize.Bicubic(clip=original, format=vs.YUV420P8)
            # fieldmatched will be YUV444P16.
            fieldmatched = c.vivtc.VFM(clip=yv12, order=1, clip2=original)



.. function:: VDecimate(clip clip[, int cycle=5, bint chroma=1, float dupthresh=1.1, float scthresh=15, int blockx=32, int blocky=32, clip clip2, string ovr=""])
   :module: vivtc

   VDecimate is a decimation filter. It drops one in every *cycle* frames -- the one that is most likely to be a duplicate (mode 0 in TDecimate).

   Parameters:
      clip
         Input clip. Must have constant format and dimensions, known length, integer sample type, and bit depth between 8 and 16 bits per sample.

      cycle
         Size of a cycle, in frames. One in every *cycle* frames will be decimated.

         Default: 5.

      chroma
         Controls whether the chroma is considered when calculating frame difference metrics.

         Default: true when the input clip has chroma.

      dupthresh
         This sets the threshold for duplicate detection. If the difference metric for a frame is less
         than or equal to this value then it is declared a duplicate. This value is a percentage
         of maximum change for a block defined by the *blockx* and *blocky* values, so 1.1 means 1.1% of maximum possible change.

         Default: 1.1.

      scthresh
         Sets the threshold for detecting scene changes. This value is a percentage
         of maximum change for the luma plane. Good values are between 10 and 15.

         Default: 15.

      blockx

      blocky
         Sets the size of the blocks used for metric calculations. Larger blocks
         give better noise suppression, but also give worse detection of small movements.
         Possible values are any power of 2 between 4 and 512.

         Defaults: 32, 32.

      clip2
         This has the same purpose as VFM's *clip2* parameter.

      ovr
         Text file containing overrides. This can be used to manually choose what frames get dropped.

         Example::

            # A comment. Lines starting with # will be ignored.
            # Drop a specific frame:
            314 -
            # Drop every fourth frame, starting at frame 1001, up to frame 5403:
            1001,5403 +++-+

         The frame numbers apply to the undecimated input clip, of course.

         The decimation pattern must contain *cycle* characters.

         If the overrides mark more than one frame per cycle, the first frame marked for decimation in the cycle will be dropped.
