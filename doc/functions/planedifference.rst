PlaneDifference
===============

.. function:: PlaneDifference(clip[] clips, int plane[, string prop = 'PlaneDifference'])
   :module: std
   
   *PlaneDifference* calculates the absolute normalized difference between two *clips* for the given *plane* and stores the result in the frame property *prop* in the returned clip (which is a copy of the first clip).
   The normalization means that the result is always a float between 0 and 1, where 0 means no differences and 1 means the biggest possible difference for every pixel.
