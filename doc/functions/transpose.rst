Transpose
=========

.. function:: Transpose(clip clip)
   :module: std

   Flips the contents of the frames in the same way as a matrix transpose would
   do. Combine it with FlipVertical or FlipHorizontal to synthesize a left or
   right rotation. Calling Transpose twice in a row is the same as doing nothing
   (but slower).
