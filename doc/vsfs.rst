VSFS (VapourSynth FileSystem)
=============================

VSFS is based on `AVFS <http://www.turtlewar.org/avfs/>`_ and shares most of its
source code and functionality. This package has several uses. It can easily make
a script file openable by any application, as it appears like a real,
uncompressed avi file. It can also be used to bridge the 32/64 bit gap, since a
plain file can always be read. For instructions on how to enable it see the
installation instructions.
