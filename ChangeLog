known issues:
may deadlock with some avisynth plugins (set the number of threads, VSCore(threads=4))

r9:
works under linux and probably osx too
full source released under LGPL
it is now possible to use + to splice clips and the slicing operator to perform Trim, Reverse and SelectEvery operations on a clip
documentation of all user functions
minor fixes

r8:
portability fixes for linux
minor api additions to make filters that consume 20+ input frames/scan a whole clip feasible
added cpu state checks after filter calls
added a function type, plugins may now take a python function and evaluate it for every frame
implemented the final planned standard functions (transpose, croprel, clipselect, modifyprops)
fixed the huge memory leak in cropabs
other small fixes

r7:
includes the source for all of the std functions and the header needed to write plugins (more source coming soon)
unnamed arguments are now accepted
y4m headers now specify the colorspace for all yuv formats and gives an error when used with non-yuv
added a new B tag to y4m output that specifies the number of bits per sample (B8/B10/B16)
more minor fixes

r6:
now drops all crop calls to env->invoke(), fixes dgdecode compatibility but you have to crop yourself now
all 64bit issues fixed
added several checks to prevent the compat formats from being used by new filters
minor fixes and extra checks for everything

r5:
more python output fixes
added accept_lowercase as a setting for the core constructor
python module refinement, now all objects have a string representation with more information
other minor fixes

r4:
fixed the bad frame output from the python module
added a callback to the output function so progress can be reported
ported ffms2
raw frame data can be accessed from python

r3:
fixes even more threading and performance issues
adds special support for yuy2 and rgb32 so most avisynth filters should work
added hacks to make mvtools2 work

r2:
fixes a large number of threading issues
removed the stupid clip.vi.width thing in python, now it's simply clip.width
fixed the frame reordering in the python bindings, now frames pop out in the expected order

r1:
buggy first version
