the framerate and the frame duration property should now be a normalized number
all internal filters now return an error if the returned clip is longer than INT_MAX instead of undefined behavior

added makediff and mergediff functions
the installer will no longer prompt about closing applications unless it's really necessary
vspipe now prints the fps as well
now arguments that are None in python aren't passed on to functions, this makes supplying defaults a lot easier
added core.version_number() so scripts can easily check for a supported core version
improved multithreaded locking, almost all functions in the vsscript and core API should be completely thread-safe now
Lut2, Merge and MaskedMerge functions changed, they now take two clip arguments named clipa and clipb instead of a 2 clip array, the old version is accepted as well for now, do vs.get_core(r21_arg_compat=False) to disable backward compatibility
minor API change, filters will no longer receive requests for frames beyond the end of a clip, instead the requested frame number is truncated, unknown length clip behavior is unchanged
simplified the vsscript api sample to use getFrame() and to be pure C code

optimized 8 bit merge and maskedmerge
fixed crash bugs in planeaverage/difference/cliptoprop/proptoclip introduced in r20

rewrote the ugliest threading code, the locking is now a bit more fine grained in general
added frameeval, a function to allow per frame filter evaluation
blankclip now generates a new frame on every request to keep memory usage down, added the keep argument to optionally always return the same frame
the message handler now takes an extra user data pointer, the handler and data pointer is still per process instead of per core though
added plugin autoloading for linux (jackoneill)
added plugin autoloading for windows, autoloaded plugins for all users go into <installdir>\plugins and per user autoloaded plugins go into <appdata>\vapoursynth\plugins
include the python backtrace in errors when available

added -version option to vspipe and other small fixes
addborders now properly rejects clips where the colorspace can change

lut/lut2 now processes all planes by default
ported to work on arm and powerpc (Zor)

output is no longer determined by setting the last variable in __main__, instead clip.set_output(int index = 0) is used to set which clip(s) are exported
fixed some memory leaks in the internal filters when they're freed (jackoneill)
now properly initializes blankclips to all 0 when no values are given
added proper const declarations now that cython supports it, cython 0.18 or later required to build the extension now
fixed get_write_ptr() in python to actually return a write pointer
fixed the lut and lut2 filters for > 8 bit formats (ADub)
various minor fixes to vivtc
removed clip.output() since it's a bad design decision, now a command-line program called vspipe can be used to pipe or write raw video output
renamed newMap() to createMap() to match the naming of all other functions
added core.get_plugins() for the core and core.namepace.get_functions() for namespaces, it works similarly to list_functions() but instead returns the information in a dict

there's now a sane external api available for embedding in other applications, see vsscript.h and vsvfw for an example
now a singleton pattern is used for the core in python scripts, use vs.get_core() to get a reference to it

fixed addborders for formats with over 8 bits per sample
blankclip can now produce float clips

added an inappropriately named subtitle filter based on libass (lachs0r)
EEDI3 has now been changed into pure C (jackoneill)

added ClipToProp and PropToClip functions, they allow one clip to be attached to another clip as frame properties
fixed a reference leak in vivtc

added len() support for clips in python
fixed a bug with plugin functions having array output in python

added vivtc (aka tivtc lite) to the included filters
the fpu state check now only outputs a warning instead of terminating (this is until I've been able to locate why certain people trigger it)

fixed memory leaks in PlaneDifference and PlaneAverage

r13:
enabled another part of the cache size adjustment, cache sizes will now be aggressively reduced to keep framebuffer memory use below 1GB
filters can now get passed zero length arrays, the rewritten parts also improves argument handling in python (integer types now get converted to float implicitly when passed as a function argument)
added right click\new\vapoursynth script shortcut to the installer
make the number of frames in progress equal the number of threads, this should always be the upper beneficial value for any script, previously it was fixed at 10
fixed a rowsize bug in avisynth compatibility and implemented the subframe functions
added PEMVerify, a function to check for out of bounds values in filter output for developers
added PlaneDifference and PlaneAverage functions for use in conditional filtering
added copy(), and get_write_ptr() to clips in python, renamed get_data() to get_read_ptr()
greatly improved the handling of SelectClip and ModifyFrame (formerly ModifyProps), conditional filtering is now something that's usable
using ModifyFrame and a bit of cleverness it is now possible to implement fairly complex filters in python

works under linux and probably osx too
full source released under LGPL
it is now possible to use + to splice clips and the slicing operator to perform Trim, Reverse and SelectEvery operations on a clip
documentation of all user functions
