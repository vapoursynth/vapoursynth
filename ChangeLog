assvapour was renamed to sub and now supports bitmap subtitles as well (jackoneill)
alternative python installations can now be selected when installing on windows, note that there many pitfalls when not using python from python.org

removed planeaverage

r31:
the nfmakelinear handling now takes the number of used threads into consideration, this makes it work properly with hundreds of threads

the installer now also writes the path to vapoursynth.dll and vsscript.dll to the registry to make them easier to locate, vsscript.dll will probably stop being installed in the system dir in r33

added setframeprop filter (nodame)
the framerate and the frame duration property should now be a normalized number
all internal filters now return an error if the returned clip is longer than INT_MAX instead of undefined behavior
"unknown" length clips have been deprecated and a fatal error will happen if any plugin returns them, this change is because it was complicated, annoying and accomplished nothing compared to INT_MAX length clips
freezeframes now doesn't need to have the ranges specified in ascending order
interleave, separatefield and selectevery now properly adjusts the framerate including the durations

now uses the proper python exception for missing attributes
added getPluginPath function to the api so it's possible for plugins to load resources in relative paths in a reliable way, the returned paths are always absolute and use forward slashes

added makediff and mergediff functions
the installer will no longer prompt about closing applications unless it's really necessary
vspipe now prints the fps as well
now arguments that are None in python aren't passed on to functions, this makes supplying defaults a lot easier
added core.version_number() so scripts can easily check for a supported core version
improved multithreaded locking, almost all functions in the vsscript and core API should be completely thread-safe now
Lut2, Merge and MaskedMerge functions changed, they now take two clip arguments named clipa and clipb instead of a 2 clip array, the old version is accepted as well for now, do vs.get_core(r21_arg_compat=False) to disable backward compatibility

added proper const declarations now that cython supports it, cython 0.18 or later required to build the extension now
fixed get_write_ptr() in python to actually return a write pointer
fixed the lut and lut2 filters for > 8 bit formats (ADub)
various minor fixes to vivtc
removed clip.output() since it's a bad design decision, now a command-line program called vspipe can be used to pipe or write raw video output
renamed newMap() to createMap() to match the naming of all other functions
added core.get_plugins() for the core and core.namepace.get_functions() for namespaces, it works similarly to list_functions() but instead returns the information in a dict

there's now a sane external api available for embedding in other applications, see vsscript.h and vsvfw for an example

fixed memory leaks in PlaneDifference and PlaneAverage

r13:
enabled another part of the cache size adjustment, cache sizes will now be aggressively reduced to keep framebuffer memory use below 1GB
filters can now get passed zero length arrays, the rewritten parts also improves argument handling in python (integer types now get converted to float implicitly when passed as a function argument)
added right click\new\vapoursynth script shortcut to the installer
make the number of frames in progress equal the number of threads, this should always be the upper beneficial value for any script, previously it was fixed at 10

added PEMVerify, a function to check for out of bounds values in filter output for developers
added PlaneDifference and PlaneAverage functions for use in conditional filtering
added copy(), and get_write_ptr() to clips in python, renamed get_data() to get_read_ptr()
