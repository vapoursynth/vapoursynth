Default install paths are assumed in all projects and scripts, be prepared to adjust many things if you changed them

Needs Visual Studio 2019 and vsnasm (https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM)
It also needs both 32 and 64 bit Python 3.7 series with recent setuptools, wheel, cython, sphinx and sphinx-intl installed
Inno setup 6.x is needed to create the installer (default installation path assumed)
7-zip is needed to compress the portable version (default installation path assumed)

Clone VapourSynth
Clone VSRepo into the VapourSynth dir (https://github.com/vapoursynth/vsrepo)
Clone zimg v2.9 branch into the VapourSynth dir (https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg)
Clone avs+ pinterf mt branch into the VapourSynth dir (https://github.com/pinterf/AviSynthPlus/tree/MT)
Compile 32 and 64 bit releases using the VapourSynth solution
Run cython_build.bat to compile the Python modules
Run make_docs.bat to compile the documentation
All the above steps are necessary to create the installer

In order to build the installer you need to download
and place isxdl.dll in "installer\scripts\isxdl".
It can be downloaded from:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20868/NET-Framework-Installer-for-InnoSetup

There are also a few plugins that aren't included
which are easier to simply retrieve from an existing
VapourSynth installation/portable release.

Note that the Avisynth side of AVFS won't work properly in debug builds (memory allocation and exceptions across module boundaries trolololol)
Likewise AviSource can only be compiled as a release build (or debug versions of functions that aren't present are referenced)
